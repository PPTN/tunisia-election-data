- eligible voters vs / actively registrered: the objective is to visually illustrate the disparty betwsen registered voters and eleigible voters by delegation to highlight the need for more robost registration efforts before the upcoming elections , because  if u were the election commission u can detect the week spotwhere u should make more efforts , civil society also would make sure that ...
for political parties u can see than there is an area where u can win  more votes  : delegation level ( binning ?) 
- heatmapping party results strength  down to polling center level ( the winning parties : nahdha  ) +
  it would also be nice to heamap takatoll and CPR  parties ( in the same map ) 

- cancelled  ballots  down to polling centers , it might  point a problem related to voter education  , we 'd like to see if rural parts of the country or poor parts are the ones with higher cancelled ballots 
( wasted + spoiled + blank + cancelled)  at  electoral districts  , to see how much votes didn't matter , it tells how fair was the system , too many candidates split the votes in too many directions that
